    <p id="text">Gandalf: 'How bright your garden looks!'
        Bilbo: 'Yes. I am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dear old Shire; but I think I need a holiday'
        Gandalf: 'You mean to go on with your plan then?'
        Bilbo: 'I do. I made up my mind months ago, and I haven't changed it.'
        Gandalf: 'Very well. It is no good saying any more. Stick to your plan — your whole plan, mind — and I hope it will turn out for the best, for you, and for all of us.'
        Bilbo: 'I hope so. Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday, and have my little joke.'
        Gandalf: 'Who will laugh, I wonder?'
        Bilbo: 'We shall see.'
